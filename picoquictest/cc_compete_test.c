/* Congestion compete test.
* These tests measure what happens when multiple connections fight for the same
* resource. The typical scenario involves connections with lots of data to
* send, with a duration sufficient to test congestion control mechanisms.
* An example would be testing BBR against itself, against Cubic, and against Reno.
* We will consider a "connection under test", and treat the other connections
* as "background".
*
* We are not aiming for an exact sharing between the competing connections, but we
* would like to verify that "nobody starves". The "main" connection should
* get a reasonable share of the bandwidth, say at least 25%, and it should also
* not get an excessive share, say no more than 80%. (Of course these numbers
* should not be hardcoded.)
*
* We know that effects like "latecomer advantage" may favor a new connection
* over the existing ones. We need to be able to program scenarios in which the
* connection hunder test starts either before or after the background connection.
*
* The first priority is to consider "duels" between the tested connection and the
* background connections. However, we may want to try scenarios with more than
* two connections.
*
* The tests rely on the "picoquic_ns" simulator.

/* The current version of the "compete_d_cubic" test shows how the throughput
