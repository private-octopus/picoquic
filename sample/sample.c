/* The "sample" project builds a simple file transfer program that can be 
 * instantiated in client or server mode. The programe can be instantiated
 * as either:
 *    picoquic_sample client server_name port folder *queried_file
 * or:
 *    picoquic_sample server port cert_file private_key_file folder
 *
 * The client opens a quic connection to the server, and then fetches 
 * the listed files. The client opens one bidir client stream for each
 * file, writes the requested file name in the stream data, and then
 * marks the stream as finished. The server reads the file name, and
 * if the named file is present in the server's folder, sends the file
 * content on the same stream, marking the fin of the stream when all
 * bytes are sent. If the file is not available, the server resets the
 * stream. If the client receives the file, it writes its content in the
 * client's folder.
 *
 * Server or client close the connection if it remains inactive for
 * more than 10 seconds.
