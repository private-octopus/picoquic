/*
Implementation of the BBR1 algorithm, tuned for Picoquic.

The main idea of BBR1 is to track the "bottleneck bandwidth", and to tune the
transport stack to send exactly at that speed. This ensures good network
utilisation while avoiding the building of queues. To do that the stack
needs to constantly estimate the available data rate. It does that by
measuring the rate at which acknowledgements come back, providing what it
calls the delivery rate.

That approach includes an implicit feedback loop. The delivery rate can never
exceed the sending rate. That will effectively detects a transmission slow
down due to partial congestion, but if the algorithm just did that the
sending rate will remain constant when the network is lightly loaded
and ratchet down during time of congestion, leading to very low efficiency.
The available bandwidth can only be tested by occasionally sending faster
than the measured delivery rate.

BBR1 does that by following a cycle of "send, test and drain". During the
sending period, the stack sends at the measured rate. During the testing
period, it sends faster, 25% faster with recommended parameters. This
risk creating a queue if the bandwidth had not increased, so the test
period is followed by a drain period during which the stack sends 25%
slower than the measured rate. If the test is successful, the new bandwidth
measurement will be available at the end of the draining period, and
the increased bandwidth will be used in the next cycle.

Tuning the sending rate does not guarantee a short queue, it only
guarantees a stable queue. BBR1 controls the queue by limiting the
amount of data "in flight" (congestion window, CWIN) to the product
of the bandwidth estimate by the RTT estimate, plus a safety marging to ensure
continuous transmission. Using the average RTT there would lead to a runaway
loop in which oversized windows lead to increased queues and then increased
average RTT. Instead of average RTT, BBR1 uses a minimum RTT. Since the
mimimum RTT might vary with routing changes, the minimum RTT is measured
on a sliding window of 10 seconds.

The bandwidth estimation needs to be robust against short term variations
common in wireless networks. BBR1 retains the maximum
delivery rate observed over a series of probing intervals. Each interval
starts with a specific packet transmission and ends when that packet
or a later transmission is acknowledged. BBR1 does that by tracking
the delivered counter associated with packets and comparing it to
the delivered counter at start of period.

During start-up, BBR1 performs its own equivalent of Reno's slow-start.
It does that by using a pacing gain of 2.89, i.e. sending 2.89 times
faster than the measured maximum. It exits slow start when it found
a bandwidth sufficient to fill the pipe.

The bandwidth measurements can be wrong if the application is not sending
enough data to fill the pipe. BBR1 tracks that, and does not reduce bandwidth
or exit slow start if the application is limiting transmission.

This implementation follows draft-cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control,
with a couple of changes for handling the multipath nature of quic.
There is a BBR1 control state per path.
Most of BBR1 the variables defined in the draft are implemented
in the "BBR1 state" structure, with a few exceptions:

* BBR1.delivered is represented by path_x.delivered, and is maintained
  as part of ACK processing

* We use "bytes_in_transit", which is already maintained by the stack.

* Compute bytes_delivered by summing all calls to ACK(bytes) before
  the call to RTT update.

* In the Probe BW mode, the draft suggests cwnd_gain = 2. We observed
  that this results in queue sizes of 2, which is too high, so we
  reset that to 1.125.

The "packet" variables are defined in the picoquic_packet_t.

Early testing showed that BBR1 startup phase requires several more RTT
than the Hystart process used in modern versions of Reno or Cubic. BBR1
only ramps up the data rate after the first bandwidth measurement is
available, 2*RTT after start, while Reno or Cubic start ramping up
after just 1 RTT. BBR1 only exits startup if three consecutive RTT
pass without significant BW measurement increase, which not only
adds delay but also creates big queues as data is sent at 2.89 times
the bottleneck rate. This is a tradeoff: longer search for bandwidth in
slow start is less likely to stop too early because of transient
issues, but one high bandwidth and long delay links this translates
to long delays and a big batch of packet losses.

This BBR1 implementation addresses these issues by switching to
Hystart instead of startup if the RTT is above the Reno target of
100 ms.

/* Detection of leaky-bucket pacers.
 * This is based on code added to BBR1 after the IETF draft was published.
 * The code detect whether the connection is being "policed" by a leaky-bucket based
 * parser, and introduces state variables:
 * - lt_use_bw, boolean: check whether the connection is currently constrained
 *   to use a limited bandwidth.
 * - lt_rtt_cnt: number of RTT during which the bandwidth has been limited. Exit the
 *   limited bandwidth state when this reaches the maximum value.
 * - lt_is_sampling: whether the connection is sampling the number of loss
 *   intervals. This starts when the first losses are noticed. It is reset if
 *   the bandwidth is app limited.
 * Sampling lasts for a number of rounds, as counted by the round_start
 * variable. No action taken except updating counters in that state.
 * Sampling can only ends on an interval when losses are detected, to avoid
 * undercounting. If no loss, sampling continues after the min required
 * interval. If no losses for too long, sampling state is reset.
 * At the end of the sampling interval compute the ratio of packets lost
 * to packet delivered. If it is below threshold, continue sampling, i.e.,
 * extend the interval.
 * If loss rate exceed the threshold, compute the duration of the interval.
 * If it is too short, extend. If is is too long, reset the sampling.
 * Else, compute the delivery rate for the interval. Check whether this
 * is the first detection, in which case do nothing but remember the estimated
 * rate in "lt_bw". Else, check whether the new rate is "close enough" to
 * the previous rate, which indicates active policing. If that is true,
 * activate policing to the average rate between current and previous sample.
 */

/* Reaction to losses and ECN
 * This code is an implementation of BBR1v1, which pretty much ignores packet
 * losses or ECN marks. Google has still developed BBR1v2, which is generally
 * considered much more robust. Once the BBR1v2 specification is available,
 * we should develop it. However, before BBR1v2 is there, we need to fix the
 * most egregious issues in BBR1 v1. For example, in a test, we show that if
 * a receiver starts a high speed download and then disappears, the sender
 * will only close the connection after repeating over 1000 packets,
 * compared to only 32 with New Reno or Cubic. This is because BBR1 does
 * not slow down or reduce the CWIN on loss indication, even when there
 * are many loss indications. 
 *
 * We implement the following fixes:
 *
 * - On basic loss indication, run a filter to determine whether the loss
 *   rate is getting too high. This will allow the code to continue
 *   ignoring low loss rates, but somehow react to high loss rates.
 *
 * - If high loss rate is detected, halve the congestion window. Do
 *   the same if an EC mark is received.
 *
 * - If a timeout loss is detected, reduce the window to the minimum
 *   value.
 *
 * This needs to be coordinated with the BBR1 state machine. We implement
 * it as such:
 *
 * - if the state is start-up or start-up-long-rtt, exit startup
 *   and move to a drain state.
 * - if the state is probe-bw, start the new period with a conservative
 *   packet window (trigger by cycle_on_loss state variable)
 * - if the state is probe-RTT, do nothing special...
 *
 * The packet losses and congestion signals should be used only once per
 * RTT. We filter with a "loss period start time" value, and only
 * take signals into account if they happen 1-RTT after the current
 * loss start time. However, if the previous loss was not due to
 * timeout, the timeout will still be handled.
 */

/*
* Handling of suspension
* 
* After a timeout, the path is suspended, and the congestion window is
* immediately reduced. If do not do anything in particular, the
* suspended state will be cleared on the first next acknowledgement,
* and the congestion window will be restored gradually.
* 
* This is correct in general, when the timeout is due to some series
* of packet loss events. It is not so good in the particular case of
* Wi-Fi suspension, when the timeout is caused by the Wi-Fi link
* being "suspended" for the time needed to scan other channels. In that
* case, the code will receive a "spurious time out" notification,
* typically triggered when an ACK queued "in the network" is delivered
* when transmission resume. Waiting for the next ACK has two
* downsides:
* 
* - it comes some times later, something like 1/2 RTT to 1 full RTT.
* - the CWIND is lower than if the suspension had not happened.
*
* The reasonable solution is to exit the suspended state upon
* notification of spurious reset, and restore the prior cwin.
