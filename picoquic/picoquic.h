* There are two supported modes of operation, "wall time" synchronized with the system's current time function,
* and "simulated time". Production services are expected to use wall time, tests and simulation use the
* simulated time. The simulated time is held in a 64 bit counter, the address of which is passed as 
* the "p_simulated_time" parameter to picoquic_create().
*
* The time management needs to be consistent with the functions used internally by the TLS package "picotls".
* If the argument "p_simulated_time" is NULL, picotls will use "wall time", accessed through system API.
* If the argument is set, the default time function of picotls will be overridden by a function that
* reads the value of *p_simulated_time.
*
* The function "picoquic_current_time()" reads the wall time in microseconds, using the same system calls
* as picotls. The default socket code in "picosock.[ch]" uses that time function, and returns the time
* at which messages arrived. 
*

* context, which can be either the current wall time or the simulated time, depending on how the

 *

 * the new path when validated will replace the default path.
 * The "abandon path" should only be used if multipath is enabled, and if more than
 * one path is available -- otherwise, just close the connection. If the command
 * is accepted, the peer will be informed of the need to close the path, and the
 * path will be demoted after a short delay.
 * 
 * Path event callbacks can be enabled by calling "picoquic_enable_path_callbacks".
 * This can be set as the default for new connections by calling
 * "picoquic_enable_path_callbacks_default". If enabled, the folling events
 * will be signalled by callbacks:
 * 
 *  - picoquic_callback_path_available: 
 *        A new path is available. On the client, this happens as soon as the 
 *        continuity has been verified. On the server, this happens when the
 *        continuity is verified and the client has started using the path
 *        (see section 8.2 of RFC 9000, path validation.)
 *        The same callback is used if a path was suspended, but becomes
 *        available again. 
 *  - picoquic_callback_path_suspended:
 *        A path that was available has been suspended. This happens for
 *        example if repeated transmission errors cause the scheduler to
 *        stop using that path for sending packets. 
 *  - picoquic_callback_path_deleted:
 *        An existing path has been deleted. The application should delete
 *        all references to that path.
 *  - picoquic_callback_path_quality_changed:
 *        Path parameters like RTT, data rate or packet loss rate have
 *        changed.
 * 
 * The "path" callback events use the same calling signature as the other 
 * callback events, but the definition of some fields changes:
 *  - the "stream_id" field is used to carry a "unique_path id"
 *  - the "bytes" and "length" fields are not used
 *  - the "stream_ctx" field carries the application specified "app_path_ctx"
 * The same "unique_path_id" is used to identify the path in the API calls.
 * 
 * The logical flow is that the application learns the path ID in a callback,
 * typically "picoquic_callback_path_available". If the application wants to
 * maintain path data in an app specific context, it will use a call to
 * "picoquic_set_app_path_ctx" to document it. The path created during
 * the connection setup has the unique_path_id 0.
 
 * 
 * If an error occurs, such as reference to an obsolete unique path id,
 * all the functions return -1.
 * 
 * The call to "refresh the connection ID" will trigger a renewal of the connection
 * ID used for sending packets on that path. This API is mostly used in test
 * programs. By default, picoquic will attempt to renew a path connection ID 
 * if that path resumes after a long silence: using
 * a new connection ID in these conditions makes correlation of old and new
 * connection data harder in case of NAT traversal.

 * better to play the next video frame than to wait for the complete transmission
 * of the previous one. Picoquic enables that with the "direct receive" marking. If
 * a stream is marked as "direct receive", picoquic will hand data receive on
 * that stream to the application immediately, even if it is out of sequence.
 * 
 * The data will be delivered to a direct receive callback function, which will
 * pass the pointer to the data, the stream offset and length of the data, and
 * also indicates if a fin mark was received. When the fin mark is present, the
 * fin offset of the stream is located at the sum of offset and length, and
 * the length may be null.
 *
 * The function picoquic_mark_direct_receive_stream is used to mark a stream
 * as `direct receive` and provide the callback function and context for that
 * stream. Calling that function with a NULL callback function pointer results
 * in an error.
 *
 * If stream data was queued at the time the picoquic_mark_direct_receive_stream
 * function is called, the callback will be activated immediately.
 *
 * The callback function shall return:
 * - 0 if the data was processed normally.
 * - PICOQUIC_STREAM_RECEIVE_COMPLETE if the fin bit was received once and all
 *   expected bytes on the stream have been received.
 * - An appropriate error code if an error was encountered.
 *
 * Returning an error code will cause picoquic to close the connection with the
 * corresponding transport error, or PICOQUIC_TRANSPORT_INTERNAL_ERROR if the
 * error code in the range of the PICOQUIC_ERROR_CLASS.

 * 
 * Picoquic handles priority as an 8 bit unsigned integer.
 * When ready to send stream frames, picoquic will pick the lowest priority
 * stream for which data can be send, i.e., it is available and flow control
 * allows it.
 *
 * When several streams are available at the same priority level, the
 * handling depends on the least significant bit of the priority code.
 * If that bit is zero, picoquic implements round robin scheduling and
 * select the stream on which data was least recently sent. If it is
 * one, picoquic implements FIFO scheduling and selects the stream with
 * the lowest stream id.
 * 
 * There is no formal association between priority level and stream
 * content. Application developers can pick whatever convention they
 * see fit. One possible example could be:
 * 
 * - 0: system priority, e.g., the "settings" stream in HTTP3 (round robin)
 * - 1: high priority data (FIFO)
 * - 2: high priority data (Round Robin)
 * - 4: real time audio (round robin)
 * - 6: real time video (round robin)
 * - 9: urgent data, such as CSS or JSON files (FIFO)
 * - 10: progressive data such as JPG files (round robin) 
 * - 11: web data (FIFO)
 * - 255: background data (FIFO)
 * 
 * When streams are created, the priority is set to a default value for
 * the QUIC context. By default, the default is 9 (FIFO), which mimics the
 * behavior of previous versions of picoquic before the formal priority
 * handling was introduced. The default stream priority can be changed
 * with the `picoquic_set_default_priority` API. Changing the default
 * priority only affects stream created after that change.
 * 
 * Individual stream priority can be set using `picoquic_set_stream_priority`.
 * 
 * The API `picoquic_mark_high_priority_stream` is a legacy of the previous
 * versions. It is equivalent to setting the priority of the specified
 * stream to zero if "is_high_priority" is true, or to the default
 * stream priority if it is not.

 * an "is_active" parameter. This parameter helps handling some cases:
 * 
 * - if the application marked the context ready by mistake, it 
 *   should set the "length" argument to 0, and the "is_active" argument
 *   to picoquic_datagram_not_active. This is a way of saying "oops". The
 *   stack will stop polling for datagrams, until there is a new call to
 *   "picoquic_mark_datagram_ready"
 * 
 * - if the application does have data to send but the available
 *   length indicated in the callback is too small, it should set the "length"
 *   argument to 0, and the "is_active" argument to picoquic_datagram_active_any_path.
 *   The stack will try to immediately reissue the callback in the next packet, hopefully with
 *   more space available.
 * 
 * - if the application can send data, it should set the "length"
 *   argument to the desired value, and the "is_active" argument to
 *   either 0 if there is no datagram data immediately ready to send
 *   after that, or 1 if there is some. The stack will send the requested
 *   datagram, and then do the equivalent of a call to "picoquic_mark_datagram_ready"
 *   with the value of is_active parameter.
 * 
 * The old API will not treat those scenarios as reliably. If the application
 * is polled and has nothing to send, it MUST call
 * " picoquic_mark_datagram_ready(cnx, 0);" to tell the stack to not call
 * it again, otherwise there will be a hot loop consuming a lot of CPU. If you
 * see that, you should really switch to using the new "extended" API and set
 * the "is_active" parameter.
 * 
 * In multipath environments, the application can use the API 
 * `picoquic_mark_datagram_ready_path` to signal that is is ready to send
 * datagrams on a specific path. The picoquic_provide_datagram_path_ex
 * API allows the application to mark 4 different level of activity:
 * 
 * - picoquic_datagram_not_active: not active on this path or any other.
 * - picoquic_datagram_active_any_path: active, but not specifically on this path.
 * - picoquic_datagram_active_this_path_only: ready to send datagrams on this

 * - pacing rate, expressed in bytes per second (for example, 10Mbps would be noted as 1250000)
 * - congestion window, expressed in bytes
 * - RTT, expressed in microseconds
 * 
 * If an application subscribes to pacing rate updates, it will start receiving callback events
 * of type "picoquic_callback_pacing_changed". The subscription to the updates specifies
 * two levels:
 * - decrease threshold, in bytes per second
 * - increase threshold, in bytes per second
 * An event will be generated each time the bandwidth increases or decreases by a value
 * larger than the specified threshold. The "stream_id" parameter of the callback will 
 * indicate the new pacing rate, in bytes per second.
 *
 * By default, the threshold values are set to UINT64_MAX, and no event is generated.
 * 
 * Applications may also use a set of accessor functions to obtain the current values
 * of the key congestion control parameters, for the currently selected transmission
 * path.
