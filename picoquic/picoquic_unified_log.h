/*
* Unified logging API.
*
* The logging code may be a significant part of the total application code. 
* For a variety of reasons, the code supports three modes of logging:
* - logging to a text file
* - structured logging to a binary file
* - structured logging to a qlog file
* We don't want to link all applications with the code for all three forms of
* logging, because that would inflate the size of the binaries. Instead,
* each logging option is documented by a set of function pointers in an
* "unified logging" structure. If the logging code is used, the structure
* is documented in the QUIC context created by the application.
*
* The application may document all three contexts if it wants to keep
* three types of logs, but it does not have to do that. If a logging
* type is documented, all three functions for that type shall
* be documented as well.
