/* Picoquic servers running over UDP can be both victims and enablers
 * of reflection attacks.
 *
 * Servers may be targeted by DDOS attacks, which often use reflection
 * through an unwitting UDP-based server to hide the actual source of
 * the attack, and often to amplify the volume of the attack. The
 * reflected attacks will appear as coming from the address and port
 * of the server, such as NTP, DNS, other popular services, and also
 * port number 0 in case of fragmented UDP datagrams. The code
 * protect against those by just dropping packets from a list of
 * such ports. This protection is described in this message to the
 * HTTP WG list:
 * https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2021JulSep/0053.html
 * 
 * The blog entry https://blog.cloudflare.com/reflections-on-reflections/
 * provides a list of UDP ports that Cloudflare saw used in
 * reflection attacks:
 * Count  Proto  Src port
 *  3774   udp    123        NTP
 *  1692   udp    1900       SSDP
 *   438   udp    0          IP fragmentation
 *   253   udp    53         DNS
 *    42   udp    27015      SRCDS
 *    20   udp    19         Chargen
 *    19   udp    20800      Call Of Duty
 *    16   udp    161        SNMP
 *    12   udp    389        CLDAP
 *    11   udp    111        Sunrpc
 *    10   udp    137        Netbios
 *     6   tcp    80         HTTP
 *     5   udp    27005      SRCDS
 *     2   udp    520        RIP
 * 
 * Nick Banks at Microsoft pointed to the filtering list implemented
 * in msquic:
 * https://github.com/microsoft/msquic/blob/main/src/core/binding.c#L1399
 * The list contains a different set than the one defined by cloudflare,
 * with the inclusion of services like mDNS, NetBIOS, etc. 
 *       11211,  // memcache
 *       5353,   // mDNS
 *       1900,   // SSDP
 *       500,    // IKE
 *       389,    // CLDAP
 *       161,    // SNMP
 *       138,    // NETBIOS Datagram Service
 *       137,    // NETBIOS Name Service
 *       123,    // NTP
 *       111,    // Portmap
 *       53,     // DNS
 *       19,     // Chargen
 *       17,     // Quote of the Day
 *       0,      // Unusable
 * Services like mDNS or SSDp are typical local, and thus unlikely to be
 * used for DDOS amplification. Attackers would have difficulties reaching
 * these services from outside the local network. However, the attackers
 * could forge the source address and cause the QUIC servers to bounce 
 * packets towards these services. This kind of "request forgery attacks"
 * is discussed in section 21.5 of RFC 9000. Blocking the port numbers
 * of servers targeted by such attacks provides a layer of protection.
 * 
 * There are a couple of downsides to this protection:
 * - Some of the ports listed here are part of the randomly assigned range,
 *   and a unlucky client could end up using one of these ports.
 * - Even if clients do not use a reserved port, NATs might. Not much recourse
 *   there.
 * - New vulnerable protocols are likely to be created in the future, which
 *   means that the list will have to be updated.
 * - If the server sits behind a firewall, the firewall might be a better
 *   place for maintaining a list of blocked ports.
 * 
 * The implementation provides teo mitigations against these downsides:
 * 
 * - Servers can disable the protection if they don't want it.
 * - Clients can test the port number assigned to their sockets and
 *   pick a new one if they find a collision.
