/*
Implementation of the BBR3 algorithm, tuned for Picoquic.
Based on https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control-02,
which describes BBR2 but incorporates the "bug fixes" that
differentiate BBR3 from BBR2.

Early testing showed that BBR startup phase requires several more RTT
than the Hystart process used in modern versions of Reno or Cubic. BBR
only ramps up the data rate after the first bandwidth measurement is
available, 2*RTT after start, while Reno or Cubic start ramping up
after just 1 RTT. BBR only exits startup if three consecutive RTT
pass without significant BW measurement increase, which not only
adds delay but also creates big queues as data is sent at 2.77 times
the bottleneck rate. This is a tradeoff: longer search for bandwidth in
slow start is less likely to stop too early because of transient
issues, but one high bandwidth and long delay links this translates
to long delays and a big batch of packet losses.

This BBR implementation addresses these issues by switching to
Hystart instead of startup if the RTT is above the Reno target of
250 ms.

/* Reaction to losses and ECN
* 
* TODO: port the BBRv1 code.
 */

/*
* Handling of suspension
* 
* Suspension is handled "almost" as specified in BBRv3. On an RTO (or PTO)
* timer, the "revovery" and "pto" flags are set, and the CWIN is reduced
* to "bytes in transit + 1 packet". If a second timer occurs, the
* CWIN is progressively reduced to 1 packet.
* 
* The code exits the PTO situation if the packet that triggered the PTO
* is acknowledged -- or if a later packet is acknowledged. The flags are reset,
* the old version of the CWIN is restored, and BBR re-enters "startup" mode.
* TODO: remember the prior bandwidth, and use the "BDP seed" mechanism to
* accelerate the start-up phase.

/* BBR v3 assumes that there is state associated with the acknowledgements.
 * BBR assumes that upon reception of an ACK the code immediately
 * schedule transmission of packets that are deemed lost (code was
 * modifed to do that).
 * 
 * From draft-cheng-iccrg-delivery-rate-estimation:
 * data_acked = C.delivered - P.delivered
 *            = path->delivered - packet->delivered_prior;
 * ack_elapsed = C.delivered_time - P.delivered_time

 * ack_rate = data_acked / ack_elapsed
 * 
 * ack_elapsed is NOT equal to rtt_sample, because packet->delivered_time_prior
 * may be lower than packet->send_time.
 * 
 * The ack rate is imprecise, because of ACK compression, etc. The Cheng draft
 * suggests:
 * - Define "P.first_sent_time" as the time of the first send in a flight of data,
 * - and "P.sent_time" as the time the final send in that flight of data
 *   (the send that transmits packet "P").
 * The elapsed time for sending the flight is:
 * send_elapsed = (P.sent_time - P.first_sent_time)
 *               = packet->send_time - packet->delivered_sent_prior
 * The delay to receive packets should never be larger than the send rate,
 * so we can use a filter:
 *   delivery_elapsed = max(ack_elapsed, send_elapsed)
 *   delivery_rate = data_acked / delivery_elapsed
