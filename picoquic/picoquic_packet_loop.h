* Unix/Posix systems. This will not work in some environments, if for example
* the threads should be created using a game engine API. In such cases,
* developers may use the function picoquic_start_custom_network_thread,
* passing the desired thread creation function, thread deletion function
* and thread naming function as a function pointer. The thread naming
* function will be called from inside the network thread after it is
* created, as this is required in some OSes. The thread deletion
* function will be called when the thread is delete, from inside
* the thread context destruction function.
* 
* The custom thread creation function must match the prototype 
* picoquic_custom_thread_create_fn, with the following arguments:
* 
* - void** pthread: a pointer to the thread (thread HANDLE in Windows,
*   pthread_t if using pthread),
* - picoquic_thread_fn thread_fn: the function that will be instantiated when creating the thread.
* - void* arg: the argument to thread_fn.
* 
* The return code is an integer, either 0 if success or an error code if failure.
* 
* The custom thread deletion function must match the prototype 
* picoquic_custom_thread_delete_fn, with the following arguments:
* 
* - void** pthread: a pointer to the thread, carrying the value returned
*   in pthread by the custom creation function.
* 
* The custom thread naming function must match the prototype 
* picoquic_custom_thread_delete_fn, with the following arguments:
* 
* - char const * thread_name: the desired thread name. Should be less
*   than 16 characters, including the final null terminator.
* 
* The function picoquic_start_custom_network_thread takes the following
* arguments:
* 
* - picoquic_quic_t* quic: the quic context, configured by the application
*   before starting the network thread.
* - picoquic_packet_loop_param_t* param: the loop creation parameters,
* - picoquic_custom_thread_create_fn thread_create_fn: the thread creation
*   function. If the value is NULL, the OS defaults will be used.
* - picoquic_custom_thread_create_fn thread_delete_fn: the thread
*   deletion function. If the value is NULL, the OS defaults will be used.
* - char const* thread_name: the desired thread name, or NULL if the
*   default value is sufficient.
* - picoquic_packet_loop_cb_fn loop_callback: the function that will
*   be called upon packet loop events.
* - void* loop_callback_ctx: the arguments to loop callback.
* - int * ret: error code, if any.
* 
* The function will return a pointer to the thread context, or NULL
* if an error happened.
* 
* Note that these functions set the name of the thread but do attempt to set
* the priority of the thread. Setting the name during the creation makes sense,
* as the name will typically not change during the process. It is also
* reasonably easy to set the name in a system independent way. In contrast,
* the handling of priority is system dependent, with Windows and Unix using
* different concepts, and there may be good reasons to change a thread priority
* after creation. Developers can use the system or framework APIs after the
* thread is created, using the thread handle in thread_ctx->pthread.
