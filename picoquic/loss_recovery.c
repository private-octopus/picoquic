/* Packet loss recovery logic. This is an implementation of the RACK
 * algorithm, with two key functions:
 * 
 * - picoquic_retransmit_needed: perform the packet number based loss
 *   detection.
 * - picoquic_pto_needed: perform the timer based loss detection.
 * 
 * The first action in the sender loop is normally to retransmit lost packets.
 * This is done by a call to "picoquic_retransmit_needed", which will look
 * at packets that should be considered lost. This can happen for two
 * reasons, and want to treat those two reasons differently:
 * 
 * - doing packet number based loss detection starting from the oldest
 *   packet in the queue. If number-based loss detection occurs, there is
 *   a very high chance that the packet is actually lost, and the frames
 *   in such packets shall be resent asap.
 * - doing timeout based loss detection. This should only trigger if
 *   the last "ack eliciting" packet in the queue was not acknowledged
 *   yet. There is a much higher risk of getting these timers wrong
 *   than getting number-based loss detection wrong, so we want to
 *   proceed conservatively.
 * 
 * The solution recommeded in RACK is to just push a new packet on
 * the link in case of timeout based loss detection. If that packet
 * is acknowledged, then number based loss detection will kick in,
 * thus resolving packet losses with minimal risk of spurious
 * loss detection. But there are two border cases: path suspension
 * and path breakage.
 * 
 * If the path is broken, restransmitting data on the path will
 * will mostly cause queues to build up between the sender and
 * the point of breakage. That does not seem very useful. But if
 * the path is just suspended, it makes sense to send a trial
 * packet at regular intervals. When the path is restored, the
 * peer will receive one of the trial packets and will acknowledge
 * it, enabling number based loss detection.
 * 
 * Loss detection is often used for path breakage detection. Many
 * implementations of TCP would count the number of times the last
 * packet needed to be retransmitted, and after some threshold
 * give up and abandon the connection. The problem is that breaking
 * the connection does not accumplish much, apart from providing
 * a signal to the application. Different applications might have
 * different preferences. There are two plausible compromises:
 * 
 * - Use the "idle timeout" as an indication of the application's
 *   intent, and only break the connection if the path cannot
 *   be restored within the idle timeout.
 * - Provide a "timeout" callback to the application when
 *   repeated losses occur, so the application can for example
 *   try a migration to a new path.
 * 
 * The same kind of compromise could be used in multipath
 * configuration: inform the multipath scheduler that connectivity
 * on the path is dubious, and try repeating the packets
 * presumed lost on a different path. In the current code,
 * this would mean declaring the queued packets as lost, so
 * that the individual frames in tehse packets can be sent on
 * the better path. But that should only happen if another
 * path is available.
 * 
 * The loss detection logic should be organized per path, as
 * follow:
 * 
 * - Use `picoquic_retransmit_needed` as the main call from
 *   the sending logic.
 * 
 * - For single path, call `picoquic_retransmit_needed_loop`
 *   which in turn will call `picoquic_retransmit_needed_packet`
 *   for the oldest packets in the loop, until no more
 *   packets can be processed. After that, check whether the
 *   flag `is_pto_needed` should be set for the path.
 * 
 * - For multipath, this is a bit more complex, see below.
 * 
 * At the very beginning of the handshake, the server only
 * performs regular loss recovery if the client's IP is
 * validated. After that, the path logic applies, complemented
 * by implicit acknowledgements.
 * 
 * 0RTT packets are a special case. They are sent during the
 * handshake, but acknowledgement can only be processed if the
 * client has obtained the "application" keys. Before that,
 * the "path" logic does not apply. After that, it is possible
 * that some initial or handshake packets sent before the
 * handshake complete but after the 0RTT packets will be
 * acknowledged before the 0RTT, which could confuse the
 * number based logic. In practice, this means the number
 * based logic will only apply if the later acknowledgement
 * are for 0RTT or 1RTT packets.
 * 
 * Multipath is also a special case, because of the interaction
 * between loss recovery and path scheduling. By default,
 * multipath scheduling selects among the paths with the lowest
 * "nb_retransmit". Otherwise, path are only selected when it
 * is time to send a "multipath probe" to check whether the
 * path is back up. This contradicts the "PTO" logic, which
 * expects retransmission on the same path. The other
 * difference is that when tetsing for retransmission we
 * need to tests all paths. The changes are:
 * 
 * - Visit all paths, with two options:
 *
 *   - if the packet is empty, just call the function
 *     `picoquic_retransmit_needed_loop` for the path,
 *     or a variant for "simple multipath".
 *   - if the packet is full, check whether the wake up
 *     timer shall be set, and possibly also check whether
 *     the flag `is_pto_needed` should be set.
 * 
 * - Inside the `picoquic_retransmit_needed_packet`,
 *   consider some differences:
 * 
 *     - for "probably lost" packets, just retransmit them.
 *     - in case of timeout, manage a difference between
 *       retransmission on the same path, in which case
 *       the PTO logic will work, and retransmission on
 *       a different path, for which it does not.

* Per packet processing. The code makes a series of determinations:

* - Should the content of this packet be resent?

* - Should the PTO needed flag be set for the path?
* - Should the MTU be reset?
* - Should the path be abandoned?
* - Should the code continue processing other packets queued in the path?
* - Should the wakeup timer be reset?
* 
* The decisions are based on a series of tests:
* 
* - RACK test: are there enough acknowledged packets after this one?
* - 0RTT test: is this a 0RTT packet, are we expecting ACKs for those?
* - ACK Trap: not real packets but PNs that were skipped to catch bad receiver behavior.
* - Initial retransmit: the server should repeat Initial packets because the client did
* - Pure ACK: if a packet only contains frames that do not need repeating.
* 
* TODO:
* Current decision mixe "is lost" and "needs repeating", with "on timer"
* indication. This is bad, because "needs repeating" is a decision, which
* should be in one place.
* 
* Need PTO indication is a property of the path, not a property of a packet.
* 
* Continue the loop is an artefact of the software code: simple multipath
* uses a loop per path, the other modes use a loop per number space. Leave it
* in the per packet code for now. The loop should be:
* 
* - while a packet is deemed lost (by number):
*      - maybe skip if packet is 0RTT.
*      - just delete the packet if ACK Trap. 
*      - track MTU issues
*      - try "copy for retransmit".
*          - unchain, but only delete if pure ACK.
*      - do statistics and notifications.
*      - if copied packet is empty, continue, else stop there.
* 
* - After all pure losses have been worked on, check whether the last "ACK
*   eliciting" packet is too old.
*      - if yes, set PTO needed.
*      - exit the loop.
* 
* There are a couple of issues in the PTO case. We want to repeat exactly
* one packet per PTO or Timer iteration, but we also want to repeat data
* as soon as possible. If we set the PTO flag, we will repeat the oldest
* packet in the queue, but just that one. In practice, that means
* leaving the queue alone if the PTO flag has not been reset by the
* sender.
* 
* TODO:
* Path closing logic should probably not use a hard max repeat number.
* maybe tie that to idle timeout?
* 
* Detect a path suspension.
