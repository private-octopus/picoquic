/*
 * We implement here the Prague algorithm as a simple modification of New Reno,
 * with the following changes:
 * 
 * - maintain a coefficient "alpha", exponentially smoothed value of "frac", the
 *   fraction of EC/(ECT+ECT1) notifications in previous RTT.
 *       As a slight deviation from the base prague specification, we set
 *       alpha to frac if frac is more than alpha + 0.5. This addresses the
 *       issue of sudden onset of congestion.
 * - modify HyStart to not exit immediately on ECN notification
 * - use alpha in New Reno: control amount of window increase or decrease, as
 *   in Prague spec.
 * - reset the L3S computation on "enter_recovery". This is a useful but
 *   imperfect attempt at avoiding "double dipping".
 * 
 */

/* Observations and issues:
 *
 * Exit hystart one RTT too late. Hystart ends when the first EC markings appear.
 * These are the marks cause by traffic of epoch N-1. The traffic of epoch N
 * is already in flight, will cause congestion and losses. Increasing 
 * the pacing rate or the quantum value does cause an earlier exit from
 * slow start, but the window ends up too small -- maybe due to the
 * redundant loss signal mentioned above.
 * 
 * Window shrinking after idle. There are no data in flight at the beginning
 * of the epoch. The leaky-bucket based pacing allows a quick initial flight
 * to come in. The queue increases, many packets are marked. As a consequence,
 * the window shrinks, even in the absence of losses.
 * 
 * This variant overrides the smoothing if there are sudden onset of marks.
 * Not doing that improves performance, but also causes a sharp increase in
 * the number of losses.
 * 
 * Redundant loss signals. Marks are detected at epoch[N]. Very likely, this 
 * correlates with losses one RTO timer later. The window shrunk once because
 * of the marks, shrinks again when the loss happens -- value is then too low.
 * Something similar happens in the other direction as well. Slow start exits
 * due to increased delays, observed before the end of the epoch. Shortly
 * after that, congestion marks are reported at end of epoch, causing window
 * to shrink further. Same could happen if losses are observed, followed
 * by CE marks. This is mitigated by restarting the L4S computation after
 * slow start, but the mitigation is not sufficient. It would be better
 * to wait for the a full RTT, so packets sent with excessive rate are
 * purged from the queue.
 * 
 * Correlated CE marks. If CE marks happen at epoch N, the traffic in flight
 * correpond to the old window, before the window is reduced. CE marks will
 * very likely be detected in next window, causing too much reduction. This
 * effect is much reduced if dirctly using "frac" instead of computing "alpha".
 * 
 * L4S threshold is hard to set for the AQM. Too low, and the throughput
 * drops. Too high, and the amount of losses increases too much. In the
 * tests, the threshold is set approximately BDP/4. This may be dues to
 * inefficient solutions of the issues mentioned above.
